# **App Name**: VoiceText

## Core Features:

- Encode Text: Text-to-DTMF conversion: Use a generative AI tool to transform text messages into a sequence of Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) signals for transmission over a voice call.
- Decode Audio: DTMF-to-text conversion: Use a generative AI tool to analyze incoming audio, detect DTMF signals, and convert them back into a readable text message. The AI tool decides if each DTMF tones must be interpreted as new letter or the end of transmission
- Text Display: Real-time text display: Show the decoded text in real-time within the application interface during a phone call.
- Manual Entry: Manual DTMF Input: Allow users to manually enter DTMF sequences and convert them into text, for debugging and fallback purposes.
- Manage Audio: Audio stream processing: Implement audio stream capturing and processing components, which can then passed to text encoder or decoder features

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to reflect technical precision and trustworthiness.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5) for a clean and neutral interface.
- Accent color: Teal (#009688) to highlight interactive elements and status indicators.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif font for a modern and neutral look.
- Use minimalist vector icons to represent functions like encoding, decoding, settings, and status. 
- Design a straightforward layout with clear sections for real-time text display, manual input, and call status.
- Incorporate subtle animations for text encoding/decoding feedback, such as a pulsing icon or a progress bar.
